 ABSTRACT   
This research investigates the use of a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) embedded in an Android 
device to analyse  human gait cycles in real -world conditions. Ethics approval was granted by the Human 
Research Ethics Committee (Non -Medical) at the University of the Witwatersrand (Clearance No. MIAEC 
109/24W).  
 
A mobile application model was developed to collect IMU data  of acceleration, angular velocity, and 
orientation  as well as GPS data for simultaneous motion tracking. GPS readings were used to validate 
displacement estimates derived from IMU integration, confirming the system’s reliability in real -time 
movement analysis.  
 
Data was collected across three gait categories , relaxed walking, fast walking, and jogging. Each category 
was sampled at a distinct rate to match its motion dynamics . 25 Hz for relaxed walking, 75 Hz for fast 
walking, and 100 Hz for jogging. The device was tested in two placements: inside the pocket and held by 
hand . 
IMU signals were used to map the stance  phases  for th e lower body  and swing phases for the upper body 
of the gait cycle, forming the basis for gait identification. Jogging produced peak accelerations of 18.2 m/s² 
and stance durations averaging 0.32 seconds. Relaxed walking showed lower peak accelerations around 
9.5 m/s² and longer stance durations near 0.5 8 seconds. Fast walking exhibited intermediate values, with 
stride intervals averaging 1.12 seconds. Despite increased signal noise in the handheld configuration, gait 
phase detection remained reliable.  
 
These findings demonstrate that a single IMU, combined with adaptive sampling rates and GPS validation, 
can effectively distinguish gait types and phases. The system offers a low -cost, portable solution for gait 
analysis with applications in fitness tracki ng, health monitoring, and biometric identification. Future work 
will focus on broader demographic testing and machine learning integration .

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background and Motivation  
Gait refers to the pattern of movement that enables  locomotion. It involves a rhythmic series of leg 
movements that propel the body forward while conserving energy  shown in Figure 2. The application of 
gait analysis has grown significantly, finding relevance in areas such as healthcare, sports science, security 
recognition systems, and fitness. This project focuses on gait analysis for recognition purposes  [1, 2]. 
 
A number of studies have investigated gait analysis, including notable contributions from Chen et al  [3].  
and Gaud et al.  [4]. These researchers employed different  data collection methods  for gait analyses , 
characterised  into Non -Wearable Sensors (NWS), Wearable Sensors (WS), and Image Processing (IP ). 
NWS and IP systems collect gait data in controlled environments with strategically placed sensors (refer 
to Figure 1a and Figure 1c). In contrast, WS systems offer more flexibility, allowing sensors to be 
positioned on different parts of the body  such as the hips, knees, or feet  to measure different  aspect  of gait 
(refer to  Figure 1b). 
 
a) NWS system   
b) WS system   
c) IP system  
Figure 1:Different types of sensors for gait analyses  [5, 6, 7] 
NWS and IP systems are primarily designed for controlled environments,  and they cannot  be suitable for 
observing gait in daily situations. On the other hand, WS systems can collect data in real -life situation and 
provide insights into how individuals walk.  However, a notable challenge with WS, as shown in Figure 1b, 
is that they impact  the user's walking pattern and comfort. This issue can be mitigated using  small devices 
with built -in Inertial Measurements Units  which will be elaborated upon in the Biomechanics during gait 
cycle  section  
 
1.2 Literature Review  
To examine and analyse walking patterns, understanding gait  cycle which is defined as the sequence of 
movements from one foot strike to the subsequent foot strike on the same side  is important for this study  


2 
 [8]. This section will explore more on gait cycle , detailing how movements can be analysed and the 
distinctive gait cycle  that can be identified through this analysis. These characteristics can be used for 
biometric identification to uniquely recognize individuals.  
1.2.1 Person gait cycle  
A complete gait cycle involves two distinct phases: the stance phase and the swing phase. Figure 2 
illustrates the gait cycle of a walking person, highlighting the events occurring in each phase.  
 
Figure 2:Complete gait cycle  [9] 
1.2.2 Stance and swing phase  
Stance phase  
As shown in Figure 2 above , a normal gait cycle begins and ends with the heel strike, which is when the 
leading foot first contacts  the ground. This marks the start of the load response phase, during which the 
leading foot bears the body's weight as it fully contacts the ground. The heel strike and foot flat events are 
characterized by a rapid loading of the limb. During the double su pport phase, both feet are in contact with 
the ground, providing maximum stability. In the midstance phase, the body moves forward while the 
opposite leg enters the swing phase. This position is less stable due to the narrow base of support and the 
higher centre of gravity. The heel off event, where the heel lifts from the ground, signals the transition from 
midstance to terminal stance. In the terminal stance phase, the body continues to move forward until the 
pre-swing phase begins, leading to the toe -off event where the toes lose contact with the ground  [10]. 
 
Swing phase  
The swing phase then begins as the swinging leg moves forward past the stance leg, contributing to forward 
progression. This phase is divided into three sub -phases  name ly, the initial swing, where the leg accelerates 


3 
 forward; the mid -swing, where the leg passes the opposite stance leg; and the terminal swing, where the 
leg decelerates in preparation for the next heel strike, which will end the swing phase  [10]. 
 
The events in each part of the gait cycle help track the movement of the lower limb. They are important 
for identifying and distinguishing each step during walking . This swing and stance phases are used to 
specified different condition when modelling the human walking pattern.  Other factor that are induced 
during the gait cycle are hip rotation and arm swing  which are explained below  
 
Hip rotation  
Throughout the gait cycle, hip rotation shows distinct patterns influenced by both static and dynamic 
positions. During the stance phase, the hip starts in a neutral position at initial contact, then increases 
internal rotation as weight shifts onto the le g to accommodate ground forces. This internal rotation has a 
strong correlation with static hip rotation, suggesting that the resting position can help predict movement 
during walking. In midstance, the connection between static and mid -pivot rotations enh ances balance and 
stability. As the gait transitions to terminal stance, the hip may begin to rotate externally in preparation for 
push -off. In the swing phase, the hip flexes while continuing to rotate internally to help clear the foot, and 
then it rotate s externally near the end to align properly for the next step  [11].

 Arm swing phases  
The gait cycle, involving the lower limbs, also results in  the movement of the upper body, specifically the 
arms. During walking, arm swinging can be classified into phases  of swing  based on their movement and 
angles relative  to the legs. Figure  below shows the definition of swinging of arms  
 
Figure 4:Swing movement of arm during gait cycle  [12] 
Studies have indicated that arm swing plays a n important role in maintaining balance and improving energy 
efficiency during walking. The synchronized movement of the arms counteracts the leg movements  as 
shown in Figure 5, contributing to stability throughout the gait cycle. As one leg advances, the opposite 
arm swings forward, providing a counterbalance that helps to prevent falling. This coordination is 
important for maintaining an upright posture . In terms of energy efficiency, the motion of the arms 
decreases the energy needed for walking by reducing the angular momentum produced by the legs. This 
lowered energy expenditure facilitates a more fluid walking pattern, allowing individuals to save ener gy 
over longer distances  [13].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the gait cycle  shown in Figure 5 above , the positions of the legs and corresponding arm movements 
are closely coordinated. At P1, when the right heel strikes, the left arm swings forward to maximum. At 
P2, as the left leg reaches maximum swing, the right arm also moves forward. When the left t oe lifts off at 
   P1  P2             P3                 P4                 P5       P6             P7 
Figure 5:Arm swing movement during gait cycle  [25] 

5 
 P3, the left arm begins to move back. In P4, the right arm transitions forward as the left leg enters mid 
swing. At P5, during right mid stance, the left arm moves back. This pattern continues: as the left heel 
strikes at P7, the right arm swings forward, and as the right leg reaches maximum swing at P8, the left arm 
mirrors this motion  
1.2.3 Biomechanics during gait cycle  
Gait analysis is based on two primary methods  of system which are  kinematics and kinetics  [10]. Kinetics 
examines the forces involved in generating walking movements  as shown below in Figure 6a. These forces 
are calculated from ground -reaction forces and then traced through the lower limbs and joints using 
biomechanical models. Kinematics  (shown in Figure 6b) focuses on the movement of the body through 
space, analysing the position and motion of body segments and the angular displacements of joints . 
 
a) Kinetic gait analysis   
b) Kinematics gait analysis  
Figure 6:Different biomechanics analyses of gait cycle  [14] 
Both types of analyses in Figure 6 can be achieved using wearable sensor systems, which are advantageous 
due to their affordability and ease of integration  to the human body  and ability to be used outside laboratory  
or controlled environment which can be used in everyday real -life activities .

6 
 For a comprehensive kinetic gait analysis, sensors are required to measure the ground reaction forces 
between the foot and the ground. The standard sensors used for this purpose are wearable Ground Reaction 
Force (GRF) sensors as shown in Figure 7a. In contrast, kinematic gait analysis as shown in Figure 7b and 
Figure 7c makes  use of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). IMUs are preferred as they can be mounted 
on various  body parts relevant to the study, such as the feet, hips, or femur, thereby offering a broad range 
of gait analysis. IMUs are commonly incorporated into wearable devices, including smartwatches and 
smartphones, which can be used during everyday activities  without affecting the individual’s walking 
pattern . 
The use of GRF sensors will compromise the accuracy of gait analysis due to potential alterations in the 
user’s walking pattern and comfort. GRF sensors are often integrated into shoes or insoles, which can 
interfere with the user’s preferred footwear and overall comfort. Given  these considerations, kinematic gait 
analysis using IMU is more suitable for this research project due to their minimal impact on the user’s 
natural walking pattern and their flexibility in placement.  
 
IMU Sensors for Gait Cycle  
An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is a device that combines several sensors to track different types of 
motion and orientation. It has accelerometers that measure acceleration along three axes, detecting changes 
in speed and direction. The IMU also includ es gyroscopes that measure the rate of rotation around three 
axes, showing how the device or system is rotating. It also allows  the measuring of the orientation of the 
device  [15]. 
 
Accelerometer sensor in gait cycle  
In gait analysis, an accelerometer sensor is used to measure the directional acceleration of motion. The 
acceleration recorded by the accelerometer corresponds to the body part on which the sensor is mounted. 
Figure 8a illustrates the accelerometer and the directions in which acceleration is measured. Figure 8b 
shows the movement of the person and the different axes involved  ( 𝑥, 𝑦, and 𝑧). The acceleration along 
these  axes is denoted as 𝑥̈, 𝑦̈ and 𝑧̈ respectively.

Gyroscope sensor in gait cycle  
Because some segment s of the body  where the IMU is mounted for gait analyses  does not only translate 
but also rotates during movement, it is important  to measure the angular velocity of specific body parts as 
they rotate around particular axes  and the angle of rotation . As shown in the Figure 9 below, walking 
involves not only forward motion but also the rotational dynamics of the lower limb segments (thigh and 
shank) at their joints. This combination of translational and rotational movement contributes to the overall 
gait cycle, which is charact erized by angular velocity .

The gyroscope measurements  (shown in Figure 9a) will capture the angular velocity of the lower limb 
segment where the IMU sensor is mounted. These measurements are oriented within the three -dimensional 
Cartesian plane of the individual, as illustrated in Figure 9b. The angular velocity is expressed in radians 
per second ( 𝑟𝑎𝑑/𝑠) and is categorized into three rotational axes  𝜃̇𝑥, 𝜃̇𝑦, and 𝜃̇𝑧 representing the angular

 velocity about the 𝑥,𝑦, and 𝑧 directions, respectively. These measurements  are important  for analysing the 
gait cycle and understanding limb dynamics during movement.  
1.2.4 Related Work  
Recent studies have increasingly focused on analysing the gait cycle of individuals using wearable sensor 
systems that make use of  Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The use of IMUs lies in their cost -
effectiveness and versatility compared to traditional laboratory setups, which often constrain movement 
and create controlled environments that may not accurately reflect real -world conditions. This limitation 
makes them less ap plicable for monitoring human gait in real -world scenarios  [18]. 
 
Most previous research has utilized either two or three IMU sensors placed on the lower limb. In studies 
employing two IMU sensors, they are typically positioned on the hip and shank. For example, the study by 
Mitchelle et al. for IMU Sensor to Segment Cal ibration  [19] illustrates this setup. Conversely, studies that 
implement three IMU sensors add an extra sensor on the foot, as shown in the work of Tobias et al. on 
IMU to Segment and Orientation Alignment for Lower Body Using DL  [20]. Figure 10a and Figure 10b 
provide visual representations of how the double and single IMU sensors are arranged on the lower limb 
segments for analysing the gait cycle

 2.1 Development of Model for Data Collection  
To access the IMU and GPS hardware values of the phone, an application model capable of retrieving real -
time data from the sensors was developed. The application was created using the Android Studio Integrated 
Development Environment (IDE)  version Ladybug | 2024.2.1  due to its features including an emulator for 
virtual testing during development without needing a physical device, and a layout editor for designing a 
user interface with built -in controls. The programming language used was Kotlin, as it allows for impor ting 
resources and libraries from Google services  such as location  that improve  application performance  for 
tracking .  
 
The developed application  model for data retrieving  includes a user interface that displays sensor readings 
from the GPS and IMU hardware. The Figure 13 illustrates the layout of each section. The kinematics 
under IMU include acceleration, which records linear acceleration in the x, y, and z directions; angular 
velocity around the x, y, and z axes of the phone; and orientation, which captures the tilting o f the phone 
based on pitch, roll, and yaw, as shown in  Figure 12. Both types of kinematic data are updated using the 
predefined update rates of SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST and SENSOR_DELAY_GAME, which provide 
the quickest updates reflecting the current state of motion.  
 
For location tracking, GPS functionality was integrated into the user interface, enabling visualization of 
longitude and latitude for tracking the path taken, as well as calculating distance and average speed. For 
GPS to function, permission to access the device's location must be granted.  
 
The user controls are designed to allow users to start and stop motion sensing on the device, with the ability 
to log motion data to a database at a specifi ed sample rate, starting as low as 1 Hz. The database used is 
Firebase Realtime Database, which supports the storage of real -time data. Firebase was chosen for its 
provision of 1 GB of total storage and 10 GB/month of download capacity.

 The Figure 13 below illustrates the developed model for data collection designed to work on Android 
phones. The directions of acceleration, angular velocity, and orientation are based  in the mobile phone 
coordinate presented in Figure 12 above . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To ensure the developed model code is functioning correctly, the virtual emulator and virtual sensors of 
the phone were configured for code validation. This process involved adjusting the sensor values to 
simulate various conditions and then monitoring the model's user interface in the emulator. Th is approach 
was to verify that the displayed values for acceleration, angular velocity, and orientation matched the 
expected outputs. Each adjustment was carefully tested to confirm that the code processes the sens or data 
accurately . The Figure 14 below shows the process of code functionality configuration

2.2 Data Collection Approach  
The experiment was conducted using Huawei  smartphone with the app installed. Motion data was recorded 
with the phone mounted on two different segments of the body: the shank, thigh, hand, and upper arm.. For 
each body segment, motion recordings were taken three times, differentiated by the type of movement: 
relaxed walking, fast walking, and jogging.  


13 
  
The motion data recorded from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) included acceleration, orientation, 
and pitch, while GPS data provided longitude and latitude for motion tracking. For relaxed walking, a 
sampling rate of 25 Hz was set; for fast walking, th e sampling rate increased to 50 Hz; and for jogging, a 
sampling rate of 75 Hz was employed. This increase in sampling rate from relaxed walking to jogging was 
implemented to accommodate the faster changes in motion occurring during these activities. As the  speed 
of movement increases, the kinematic changes also require a higher sampling rate to accurately capture 
these variations, ensuring that the collected motion data reflects the true nature of the movements.  
 
The same device was used throughout the data collection process, with a minimum distance travelled of 
20 meters. This distance was chosen to ensure that the requested sampling rate did not exceed the limits of 
the database. Data collection was performed ou tside the building, as GPS tracking yields more accurate 
results outdoors compared to indoor settings.

 3 DATA PROCESSING  
This section presents the pre -processing of the data retrieved during the motion captured in the experiments . 
3.1 Raw Data Cleaning  and Prepossessing  
The current raw data from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is displayed below  Figure 15 in graphical 
format due to the large volume of sampled values. This dataset present  only a relaxed walking scenario, 
with the phone placed in the left side pocket.  
 
Figure 15:IMU graphical raw data for a relaxed walking with a phone on the left side pocket  
The results in Figure 15 represent the acceleration in the x, y, and z directions, as well as the angular 
velocities about the x, y, and z axes. Additionally, the orientation data is included, indicating pitch, roll, 
and yaw angles .   
 
The raw data from the GPS is presented in Figure 16 below, corresponding to the relaxed walking scenario 
with the phone in the left side pocket. This dataset includes latitude, longitude, total distance, and average 
speed  


15 
 The distance between the two locations defined by longitude and latitude was determined using the 
Haversine formula, a mathematical approach for measuring the distance between two points  [21].  
The formula calculates the distance along the shortest path between the points, which are specified by their 
latitude and longitude coordinates.  
𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 =2𝑅×𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑛 (√𝑠𝑖𝑛2(𝜑1−𝜑2
2)+cos(𝜑1)cos(𝜑2)+𝑠𝑖𝑛2(λ1−𝜆2
2) ) 
where 𝑅 is the Earth's radius (6,371 km),  𝜑1−𝜑2 are the latitudes of the two locations (in radians),  and  
λ1−𝜆2 are the longitudes of the two locations (in radians) . 
 
 
Figure 16: Processing of GPS data to get the distance and average speed  


16 
 During pre -processing, the first 75 and last 75 sampled values are removed for the relaxed walking 
scenario. These values represent the initial and final 3 seconds of data collection, which do not accurately 
capture true motion, as they include the moments  of placing the phone in the pocket and removing it.  
 
For the fast-walking  scenario, the first and last 150 samples are discarded, reflecting the average sampling 
rate used during this activity. In the case of jogging, the first and last 225 samples are removed, as this data 
is collected at a higher sampling rate. This method en sures that the processed data accurately reflects the 
actual motion for each activity .  
3.2 Verification and Validation of the data  
To validate the IMU, the GPS was used. Before using the GPS for validation, the recorded latitude and 
longitude obtained from the model, which defined the tracking of the person, were traced on Google Maps. 
This was done to determine whether the coordinates accurately represented the actual p ath travelled  during 
data collection. The latitude and longitude data from the model for each experiment are shown in the figure 
below for path tracking . 
 
Figure 17: Trace d path during the data collection  
 
In both cases , the latitude accurately represented the actual path taken during the motion. The coordinates 
could be used to validate the sensor, as they effectively traced the actual walking path, as illustrated in the 
Figure 17 above .  
 


17 
 To analyse the data collected from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which includes acceleration 
𝑥̈(𝑡) measurements in three -dimensional space, integration techniques from calculus is used . The recorded 
acceleration can be integrated to determine the velocity 𝑥̇(𝑡) and position displacement 𝑥(𝑡) over time, 
using the following equations . 
Velocity calculation:  
𝑥̇(𝑡)=∫𝑥̈(𝑡)+𝑥̇0(𝑡0) 
where 𝑥̇0 is the initial  velocity at time 𝑡0 
Position calculation:  
𝑥(𝑡)=∫𝑥̇(𝑡)+𝑥0(𝑡0) 
where 𝑥0 is the initial; position at time 𝑡0 
Because  the acceleration data collected from the IMU is not continuous and consists of discrete samples 
taken at various points during motion, numerical integration methods is employed to accurately estimate 
velocity and position. The cumulative trapezoidal rule is used for numerical integration to handle the 
discrete nature of the data . The numerical integration equations used are detailed below  
 
Numerical Inte gration  
Velocity approximation : 
𝑥̇(𝑡𝑖)=𝑥̇(𝑡𝑖−1)+𝑡𝑖−𝑡𝑖−1
2(𝑥̈(𝑡𝑖−1)+𝑥̈(𝑡𝑖)) 
where 𝑥̇(𝑡𝑖) is the estimated veloci ty at time 𝑡𝑖 
Position approximation  
𝑥(𝑡𝑖)=𝑥̇(𝑡𝑖−1)+𝑡𝑖−𝑡𝑖−1
2(𝑥̇(𝑡𝑖−1)+𝑥̇(𝑡𝑖)) 
where 𝑥(𝑡𝑖) is the estimated velocity at time 𝑡𝑖 
By applying these numerical integration techniques, both velocity and position can be effectively estimated 
based on the discrete acceleration data collected from the IMU

Figure 19:IMU and GPS total distance validation  
The comparison between GPS and IMU total distance Figure 19 shows that although the GPS output 
increases linearly while the IMU follows a nonlinear trend, both methods yield comparable total distances 
over the same time duration

 4 RESULTS A  ND DISCUSSION  
4.1 Gait Identification from IMU  
This section presents an analysis of the gait cycle phases derived from data collected during motion. The 
focus is on the mapping of the Stance and Swing phases, as described in the literature review. The analysis 
includes three types of gaits: relaxed walking, fast walking, and jogging.   
4.1.1 Relaxed walking gait cycle  
For the motion o f the user when relaxed walking with the phone inside the left pocket, after being processed 
were mapped  with the gait cycle as shown below in  Figure 20. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the case of relaxed walking, where the user carried a phone in the left pocket, the processed data was 
used to map the gait cycle, as depicted in  Figure 20.

20 
 Stance phase dynamics  
From the analysis, gait identification was primarily based on three key parameters: acceleration in the x -
direction, angular velocity around the y -axis, and the tilt angle of yaw. Each of these parameters plays a 
critical role in understanding the user’s m otion:  
• Mid-stance (S1):  This phase is defined as the position where the leg is straight forward and 
perpendicular to the ground, with the yaw angle at zero. This position indicates optimal stability 
and weight distribution.  
• Transition to terminal stance (S1 → S2): As the user transitions from mid -stance to terminal 
stance, the angle of the leg reaches a minimum (approximately -15°). This change occurs because 
the leg extends backward, preparing to propel the user forward. The observed fluctuations in 
acceleration an d angular velocity during this transition underscore the variable nature of walking, 
as the user’s velocity is not constant, evidenced by changes in average speed.  
• Terminal stance (S2):  In this phase, the leg reaches its furthest backward position, resulting in 
minimal acceleration. This is a critical moment, as it indicates that the user is preparing to transition 
into the next phase of the gait cycle.  
 
Pre-Swing Phase Dynamics  
• Pre-swing (S2 → S1):  Here, the leg begins to accelerate forward from the terminal stance. This 
increase in acceleration and yaw angle reflects the leg’s movement as it prepares to initiate forward 
propulsion. The transition to this phase is marked by increasing thigh angle as  the leg moves 
forward.  
• Toe-off and mid-swing (S3 → S4 and S4 → S5):  The phases of toe -off and mid -swing indicate 
the leg’s maximum forward motion. Although the acceleration, angular velocity, and thigh 
orientation are estimated, the transitions can be approximated based on the data. The peak thigh 
angle at S5 signifies th at the leg is fully extended forward, ready to strike the ground in the next 
cycle.  
 
Swing phase dynamics  
• Terminal swing (S5):  Following the mid -swing, the leg prepares for ground contact. A sudden 
deceleration is noted here, confirming that the leg’s movement must adjust rapidly in anticipation 
of the heel strike. This aligns with the gait cycle's expectation that the leg will d ecelerate in 
preparation for a stable ground contact.  

21 
 • Loading response  (S6):  Upon ground contact, the leg enters a loading phase. The angle decreases, 
and acceleration approaches zero as the leg absorbs the impact. This phase confirms the 
stabilization of the body weight onto the stance leg.  
• Mid stance  (S7):  After the loading phase, the leg returns to mid -stance, completing the gait cycle. 
This cyclical process continues during relaxed walking, illustrating the repetitive nature of human 
locomotion.  
 
The analysis aligns well with the established understanding of the gait cycle, as outlined in the literature 
review. A normal gait cycle begins and ends with a heel strike, marking the transition from the load 
response phase to double support, where both f eet contact the ground. The mid -stance phase, characterized 
by the opposite leg entering the swing phase, is essential for forward progression.  
 
4.1.2 Fast walking gait cycle  
During fast walking, the retrieved data mapped with the gait cycle is illustrated in Figure 21. The analysis 
of fast walking relies on three key parameters: acceleration in the x -direction, angular velocity about the z -
axis, and orientation indicated by the yaw angle .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 21:Mapping gait cycle for  fast walking  with phone inside left pocket

 𝑆5 

22 
 For this analysis, S1 is designated as the reference point. S2 represents the maximum angle, approximately 
-5°, which corresponds to the terminal swing phase of the gait cycle. This maximum angle is critical as it 
indicates the transition into the next pha se. 
 
• Heel Strike and Loading Response : At S2, the heel strike occurs as the left leg makes contact 
with the ground, exhibiting an acceleration of approximately 5 m/s². This sudden impact is crucial 
for understanding the dynamics of the gait cycle. Following the heel strike, a notable change in 
angular velocity is observed, accompanied by fluctuations. These changes can be attributed to the 
phone not being securely placed in the pocket. The impact of the heel striking the ground, 
combined with inertia, causes the phone to shift until it settles b ack into the pocket.  
 
• Transitioning  segment S2 to S3 : the loading response takes place  at this segment . This phase is 
characterized by the leg absorbing the impact of the ground strike, which is essential for 
maintaining stability and preparing for the next phase of the gait cycle.  
 
• Transition to Terminal Stance  (S3):  After the loading response, the leg begins to return to a 
stance position, ultimately reaching terminal stance, denoted as S3. At this point, the angle is at its 
lowest, approximately -17°. This position is significant as it represents a moment of maximum 
stability, where the body weight is fully supported by the stance leg.  
 
• Forward Swing and Maximum Acceleration : Following  the terminal stance, the leg transitions 
into the swing phase, where it begins to move forward. As the angle increases during this forward 
motion, the acceleration reaches a peak of approximately 12 m/s². This acceleration signifies the 
force exerted as t he leg propels the body forward, illustrating the dynamic nature of fast walking.  
 
4.2 Arm S wing Cycle Identification from IMU  
This section presents the mapping of the arm motion as it correlates to the phases of the gait cycle, as 
detailed in the literature review, with the corresponding figure illustrating the different swing phases of the 
arm.  The phases are for relaxed walking, fast walking, and jogging with a mobile held by left hand . 
 
4.2.1 Relaxed walking  arm swing cycle  
The motion of relaxed walking with the phone held in the left hand is shown in the figure below, where 
the movement is divided into distinct segments. The stick figure, though not drawn to scale, represents the 

23 
 arm swing motion at various points in the gait cycle. These segments highlight the coordination between 
the arm's forward and backward swings, which correspond to the leg movements, as detailed in the gait 
cycle analysis. The figure illustrates how the arm 's motion varies throughout the cycle, contributing to 
overall balance and energy efficiency during walking. Each segment captures a specific phase of the arm 
swing . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mapping of the Arm Swing  
The cycle of the arm swing is mapped starting from the mid -swing forward direction (denoted by position 
S1). In this position:  
• S1 (Mid -Swing Forward ): The arm is in the mid -swing phase, where the yaw angle is 0°, and the 
arm is parallel to the body. At this point, the arm experiences its minimum acceleration, as it is 
neither accelerating forward nor backward.

Figure 22:Mapping of arm swing cycle to the retrieved  data from IMU  

24 
 • S1 to S2 (Forward Swing and Acceleration ): As the arm continues to swing forward from S1 to 
S2, the angle of the arm increases, and it accelerates in the forward direction. The arm reaches its 
maximum acceleration of 5 m/s² during this phase. At S2, the arm reaches its maximum forward 
position, with the angular velocity being 0 rad/s, as it momentarily stops before changing direction. 
The arm's angle reaches a maximum of approximately 38°.  
• S2 to S3 (Backward swing and deceleration ): After  S2, the arm begins to swing backward. The 
swing direction reverses, and the arm accelerates in the opposing direction. As the arm reaches the 
mid-swing backward phase (denoted by S3), it experiences minimum acceleration once again. The 
arm's orientation i s now at 0°, similar to its initial position in S1. This marks the completion of one 
full cycle, which then repeats.  
4.2.2 Fast walking arm swing cycle  
The mapping results for fast walking with the phone held in the left hand are shown in the figure below. 
This mapping illustrates the differences in the arm swing dynamics compared to relaxed walking, including 
variations in acceleration, swing angles, and  angular velocity . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During fast walking, the arm swing pattern follows a similar cycle to relaxed walking, but with notable 
differences in terms of cycle time, acceleration, and swing angles. While the basic coordination of arm and 
leg movements remains the same, the paramete rs differ due to the increased speed of walking.  
𝑆1 
 𝑆2 
 𝑆3 
 𝑆4 
Figure 23:Mapping of fast walking arm swing cycle  

25 
  
• Maximum and minimum acceleration:  In fast walking, the arm experiences a much higher 
acceleration, reaching a maximum of 10 m/s² and a minimum of -10 m/s², compared to the lower 
accelerations observed during relaxed walking.  
• Swing angles:  The arm's swing amplitude is greater, with maximum and minimum swing angles 
of approximately 58° and -20°, respectively, reflecting the increased range of motion in fast 
walking.  
• Angular velocity:  The arm's angular velocity also increases, reaching a maximum of 5 rad/s and 
a minimum of -5 rad/s, indicating the faster motion and quicker transitions between forward and 
backward swings.  
These differences reflect the increased intensity and speed of the movement in fast walking, which leads 
to higher accelerations, greater angular velocities, and a broader range of arm motion compared to the 
relaxed walking cycle

4.3.1 Rate of  the forward movement  
Acceleration along the x -axis provides an important  measure of the forward motion of the body during 
walking. The results from the different motion conditions  relaxed, fast, and jogging  showed clear 
distinctions in both the magnitude and variability of acceleration.  
 
Phone inside left side pocket  for relaxed, fast , and jogging  
For a relaxed walk, t he mean acceleration was -0.3169 𝑚/𝑠2 , indicating a slight deceleration in the forward 
direction  during relaxed motion  with a standard deviation of 2.7078  𝑚/𝑠2 suggests that the motion was 
more consistent with slow walking. The maximum acceleration 7.9392  𝑚/𝑠2 and minimum -20.2818  𝑚/𝑠2 
For relaxed walking, both the maximum and minimum acceleration values are high. These accelerations 
can be traced back to the path taken, as it was not smooth. In some areas, there were steep discontinuities 
in the otherwise even path, which likely led to changes in acceleration.  
 
During the fast-walking  motion, the  mean acceleration increased slightly to -0.0904  𝑚/𝑠2, and the standard 
deviation increased to 3.1405 𝑚/𝑠2, indicating more variation in the forward motion. This is expected as 

27 
 walking faster involves greater fluctuations in acceleration due to changes i n pace.  During jogging motion , 
a significant change  occurred during this motion  with a mean acceleration of 0.3724  𝑚/𝑠2, indicating a 
positive forward motion. The large standard deviation of  5.1240  𝑚/𝑠2 reflects the irregular  nature of 
jogging, which involves higher forces and larger fluctuations in acceleration as the body moves faster and 
with more forceful steps. The maximum acceleration of 10.2242  𝑚/𝑠2 represent the  consistent with the 
increased intensity of jogging.  
 
Phone held by left Hand  
The mean acceleration of 0.0670  𝑚/𝑠2 for relaxed walking with the phone held in hand was positive, 
suggesting a more stable movement compared to the pocket condition. The standard deviation (3.8087) 
was larger, reflecting slightly more variability in the hand -held condition  and for fast walking, t he standard 
deviation increased  to (6.4649), which is consistent with the more pronounced fluctuations observed when 
walking at a faster pace. The maximum acceleration of 13.2112  𝑚/𝑠2 reached its highest value in the hand 
condition, indicating more dynamic movement compared to the pocket condition.  
During jogging , the acceleration was highly variable, with a mean of 3.3617  𝑚/𝑠2 and a large standard 
deviation of 14.5998, reflecting the intense motion of jogging. The maximum acceleration 35.9450  𝑚/𝑠2 
was much higher than any other condition, highlighting the significant increase in forward movement 
during jogging when the phone is held in the hand  
 
4.3.2 Orientation  of body segment  
Yaw in this research project was  describ ing the angular displacement of the device relative to the x -axis, 
indicating the angle of the thigh during different phases of walking. A minimum yaw corresponds to the 
terminal stance phase, where the leg is fully extended whereas maximum yaw indicates the terminal swing 
phase, just before the heel strike, where the leg is in the swing phase.  
 
Phone inside a pocket  
During the relax motion,  the mean yaw was -3.92°, indicating that during relaxed walking, the thigh was 
positioned closer to the terminal stance phase. The standard deviation of 6.37° suggests that there was some 
variability in thigh rotation  and for a  fast walk, t he mean yaw decreased slightly to -3.23°, indicating that 
the device remained in a position close to the terminal stance phase during fast walking, with the thigh in 
a similar orientation . The smaller standard deviation of 3.82° suggests that the rotation of the thigh was 
more stable during faster walking, with less variability in the leg's movement  and for jogging,  the yaw 
during jogging showed larger fluctuations, with a mean value of -3.23° and a standard deviation of 9.24°. 

28 
 This suggests that there was significant rotational movement of the thigh due to the increased dynamics of 
jogging, considering the higher force and speed during this activity.  
 
Phone held by left hand  
The mean yaw for the hand -held condition during relaxed walking was 13.68°, indicating a shift toward 
the terminal swing phase of the leg. This suggests that during relaxed walking with the phone held in the 
hand, the leg was positioned just before the hee l strike, with outward rotation of the thigh. The high standard 
deviation (16.81°) indicates substantial variation in the thigh's orientation, likely due to more noticeable 
body rotation and posture changes. During fast walk, t he mean yaw decreased slightl y to 13.04°, and the 
standard deviation of 29.04° was still quite large compared to the relaxed walking condition. This suggests 
that while the thigh's rotation remained in the terminal swing phase, the phone's orientation was still quite 
variable, reflecting the faster movements during fast walkin g. 
 
The yaw showed the highest variation during jogging, with a mean of 44.59° and a standard deviation of 
23.26°. This large variation indicates that during jogging, the phone experienced significant rotation, as the 
thigh's orientation shifted between the te rminal swing and heel strike phases with increased dynamics and 
force.

 5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) 
for gait cycle analysis in real -world settings, facilitated by a custom Android application. The project 
successfully identified distinct gait phase s (stance and swing) across various movement types, including 
relaxed walking, fast walking, and jogging. Results show that a single IMU system, positioned at various 
points on the body, can capture essential gait characteristics such as acceleration, angu lar velocity, and 
orientation, achieving an analysis quality comparable to multi -sensor setups. This portable approach 
presents a practical and non -intrusive solution for gait analysis, with potential applications in healthcare 
for patient mobility monitor ing, in security for biometric identification, and in fitness for tracking personal 
performance . 
 
Recomm endations  
To build on these findings, future work should consider expanding data collection by incorporating a more 
diverse participant group, including individuals of varying age groups, body types, and gait abnormalities, 
to improve model robustness and generaliza bility. Enhancing the Android application’s interface and 
adding automated data cleaning features would improve usability and broaden accessibility. Implementing 
real-time gait analysis and feedback functionalities could provide immediate insights, which w ould be 
especially valuable in rehabilitation and fitness tracking contexts
